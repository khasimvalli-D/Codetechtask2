OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT:REAL-TIME DATA LOGGING WITH STM32

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Use an STM32 microcontroller to log data in real-time

Interface with sensors or other devices to collect data
Store data in memory or on a storage device (e.g., SD card)
Display data on a screen or transmit it wirelessly
Components:

STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F103, STM32L476, or STM32WB55)
Sensors or devices (e.g., temperature, humidity, GPS, accelerometer)
Memory or storage device (e.g., SD card, flash memory)
Display device (e.g., LCD, OLED, or serial terminal)
Wireless module (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or LoRa)
Software:

STM32CubeMX (for configuring the microcontroller)
STM32CubeIDE (for writing and debugging code)
C programming language (or C++ or Rust)
Objective:

Learn about STM32 microcontrollers and their peripherals
Understand how to interface with sensors and devices
Practice real-time data logging and storage
Develop skills in embedded systems programming
Key Features:

Configure the STM32 microcontroller using STM32CubeMX
Write C code to read data from sensors or devices
Use interrupts and timers for efficient data logging
Store data in memory or on a storage device
Display data on a screen or transmit it wirelessly
Tips and Variations:

Use different sensors or devices to log various types of data
Implement data analysis or processing algorithms
Add a user interface (e.g., buttons, keypad, or touchscreen) Integrate with cloud services or IoT platforms
Experiment with other STM32 features (e.g., DMA, UART, or SPI)
This project offers a wide range of possibilities and challenges, making it an excellent learning experience for those interested in embedded systems and microcontrollers. If you have any questions or need help with the project, feel free to ask!NAME:-SHAIK SALMATHAJU COMPANY:-CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS INTERN ID:-CT08ES890 DOMAIN:-EMBEDDED SYSTEMS DURATIONS:JUNE TO AUGUST 2024 MENTOR:-SRAVANI
